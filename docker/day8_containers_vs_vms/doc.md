# Day 8: Containers vs Virtual Machines

## ðŸ“Œ Concepts
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Run on a hypervisor, each VM has its own full guest OS, heavy resource usage.
- **Containers**: Run on a container engine (Docker), share the host OS kernel, lightweight, faster startup.
- **Key Difference**:
  - VMs â†’ Multiple OSes on one host.
  - Containers â†’ Multiple isolated apps/services on one OS.
