# Day 12: Docker Compose â€“ Multi-Container Applications

## ðŸ”¹ What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.  
It uses a simple YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to configure services, networks, and volumes.

## ðŸ”¹ Why use it?
- Define multi-container apps in one file
- Start all services with `docker-compose up`
- Manage networking automatically
- Easy scaling (`docker-compose up --scale`)

## ðŸ”¹ Example Setup (Python + Redis)

Weâ€™ll run:
1. A **Redis service**
2. A **Python app** that connects to Redis

---

## ðŸ“œ Commands
- `docker-compose up -d` â†’ start services  
- `docker-compose ps` â†’ list running services  
- `docker-compose logs -f` â†’ follow logs  
- `docker-compose down` â†’ stop and clean up
